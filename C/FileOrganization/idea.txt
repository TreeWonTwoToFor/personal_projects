1. Folders should hold references to other types of data in the system (folders, other files).
2. Files is just text, but also could be something like a list of movies/songs.

I want to have a set of files on the computer that should help keep everything organized. 
This system isn't going to be perfect, but it should be a fun project to work on in C.

What should this system do?
	1. create files
	2. open and edit files (something like exec into vim)
	3. Have a non-linear graph structure
		a. Folders are closer to tags
		b. You can search through 'layers' of tabs. Tabs can be on folders or files.

How will this program handle this?
	1. Needs to be able to open, read, write, and save files.
	2.
