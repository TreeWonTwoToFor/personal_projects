1. I have access too
	a. The lyrics of the song in a string
	b. the parsed version of it (not a one to one comparison)
2. I need to link the string to a list of tokens
	a. get a line from the song by splicing based on the '/n' character
	b. get that same line from the token list
		1. Figure out the end token of that length
		2. tie that new list to an object
	c. tie both the string and token list together into an object (a class would be good for this)
3. output this new linked object
	a. probably some type of string output that has
		1. the original line from the song
		2. the tokens from the parser
		3. maybe some type of romaji for pronunciation
4. write this to the file
