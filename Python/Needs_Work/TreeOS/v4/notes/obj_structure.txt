1-2:  holds info about blender
3: points to the material (.mtl) file
4: 'o Cube,' which I guess means that there is a cube object in the scene?

5-12:  v - has individual vertecies
13-18: vn - maybe holds the range of how far any vertex goes?
19-32: vt - holds a pair of numbers. I have no clue what that means
33:    s - just the number 0. also have no clue what that means
34-39: f - likely which vertecies create a face. 


IDEAS:

for this program, simply getting the v and f values will be enough.
