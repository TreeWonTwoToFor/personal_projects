    if hit
        pop from top of deck
    if stand
        break out of this loop

    if dealer can have blackjack
        let the player bet on insurance
         - should only be half of the main bet max
         - isn't tied to the main bet
        allow the dealer to tell if there was BJ
            pay out/steal money
    if they can split and want to
        need to make two hands (objects)

    while winner is undetermined
        check to see if the player lost
            if they have more than 21
        check to see if the dealer has less than 17
            give another card
    We know who the winner is!
        win 
            if they got a natural 21 -> pay 3:2
            if they won normally -> pay normally
        tie
            push the bet
        loss
            take away the money they put in
    
after the bet has been handled
    ask what the player wants
        they want to play again
            do they keep the same bet?
                if yes, don't do anything
                if no, ask them for the new bet
            deal/create new shoe
        they don't want to play again
            exit out of the game
