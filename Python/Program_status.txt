NOT WORKING
Alexa Nissan Leaf: basic calculations, but no true functionallity
Blackjack: basic gameplay, still needs splitting + insurance, and there is no Visual version
chopsticks: basic visuals with no gameplay
cmd_cookie_clicker: console worked at one point, but I think seperating the files broke it.
jisho_testing: SUPER simple test. Probably not worth keeping
Language builder: I have a basic window that you can resize - but no actual functionallity for building a Language
Stoplight_sim: can generate stoplights, and roads to connect them. No car/stoplight timing functionallity.
text_editor: Chat GPT made something very basic, and it doesn't accept keyboard input

WORKING
Banshee bot: This works, but there isn't a lot of functionallity in terms of more complex functions like posting map images
CompLing word frequency: This program actually does everything that I wanted it to do when I started. 
    You can give it a text file, and It'll graph the word frequency
fun_isometric: Fun basic concept, but it doesn't have mouse movement for some reason (from what I remember implementing)
Personal_calendar: A discord bot daily to-do list that automatically posts the list every 24 hours for the user to react to
punchcard: successfully is able to convert binary to strings, and vise versa. Would be fun to connect this to an actual machine
pygame_boilerplate: This is a good base, but it might be nice to build out more of a library of game-like commands
senior quote: fully functional game of RPS in the word limit, so I'd count that as a win.
Tree_script: It can read great from text files, but a terminal version would be cool
UI Builder: This works for moving around windows by the corners, but it 
    - doesn't work by grabbing the edges of windows
    - windows don't hold any information (img or text)
    - there is no way to save a UI for later.
