            <h2>What do I need to play?</h2>
            You need one deck unique card deck per person playing.<br>
            If you want to keep score, you'll need a pen and pad, or a phone.<br>
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            To start setting up your Nertz game, shuffle the deck, 
            then deal 10 cards face down slighty to your left. 
            Place one more card face up on top to make an 11 card stack
            called the "Nertz Pile".<br>
            Now, place four cards face up in individual stacks to 
            the right of your "Nertz Pile".<br>
            The rest of the deck should be placed/held face down.<br>
            <h2>Game Concept</h2>
            The premise of this game is multiplayer solitare.
            Everyone is playing their own small-scale solitare game, 
            and the goal is to get rid of all of your cards in the Nertz Pile first.<br>
            You can move cards off of your Nertz Pile by either moving a card onto 
            one of the solitare stacks to the right of your Nertz Pile, 
            or by moving cards into the community zone in the middle.<br>
            Cards are added into the community zone in the middle of the board by 
            creating stacks, starting from Ace and 
            incrementing by one with a card of the same suit.<br>
            Cards may also be moved from personal solitare stacks into the community zone.<br>
