are many ways to solve a Rubik's Cube, these are called methods.
Methods may be very different, or pretty similar. Some involve many
algorithms, some are very simple to learn, and some are fast if you
practice.<br><br><h3>CFOP</h3><a href="https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/advanced-cfop-fridrich/">CFOP</a>,
or Cross F2L OLL and PLL is a very well known speedcubing method. It is
hard to learn, but only needs about 5 algorithms per solve. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><h3>Roux</h3><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Roux_method">Roux</a> is a method where you build 2 1x2x3 blocks and place the other corners and edges and centers in the right position.<br><br><h3>ZZ/ZZ-CT</h3><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/ZZ_method">ZZ</a> has 3 steps, EOLine, ZZ F2L, and LL, it is not as well known, but can be very fast. It has a LOT of algorithms. <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/ZZ-CT">ZZ-CT</a> is basically ZZ, but fixes some problems with ZZ.<br><h3><a href="https://solvethecube.com/">Beginners Method</a></h3>One of the easiest methods, easy to learn, but not very fast, minimal algorithms to learn. </body></html>
